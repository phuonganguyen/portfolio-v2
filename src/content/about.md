Hello! I'm Phuong, a software engineer based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam specializing in building exceptional, high-quality websites and applications.

As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why Iâ€™m excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.

Shortly after graduating from [Hoa Sen University](https://www.hoasen.edu.vn/en), I joined the engineering team at CSC ([DXC Technology](https://www.dxc.technology/vn_en)) where I work on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.
